### Data and viz of interest

Below is an article that relates data scinece to a humanities topic that we are interested in:
[Advancing zoo animal welfare through data science](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/veterinary-science/articles/10.3389/fvets.2024.1313182/full)

Here is a sample data visualization I would like to be able to make with Python.

![Animal Research by Species in Estonia 2015](https://speakingofresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/animal-research-by-species-in-estonia-pie-chart-2015.jpg?w=863)

I find this image interesting as it represents data on animals that are used in research in Estonia. I think it is intriguing to be able to see data on which animals are typically utilized in research. This representation would be useful to many who are interested in learning about and protecting animal rights, especially in advancing the sciences.

### Ideas for data to investigate

Here are a couple of humanities topics that piqued my interest:
* Religion and its impacts on society
* Art and its evolution
* Notions of linguistic superiority and how it hinders progress

Here are some sources I could find related to these:

### Ideas from curated datasets & project lists

This table contains some information on potential datasets and how we can use conding to explore them.

| Name | Description | Link |
|:----------------|:----------------|:----------------|
| Nixon White House Recordings    | These tapes have audio-recordings of President  Nixon's calls from the White House and the Presidential retreat at Camp David, Maryland. Coding would be useful to analyze this dataset in terms of extracting all tapes / dates / keywords involving specific situations.    | [White House Tapes of Nixon Administration](https://www.archives.gov/open/nixon/37-wht-dataset-conversationlist.html)     |
| What People had in their Houses (1700s)     | This data contains inventory on what was located inside an estate - and was used for determining "whether gender had a significant impact on how appraisers conducted probate court estate inventories." Coding would be useful in generating plots of the most common items found - and also on a more advanced scale simulating the home lifestyle someone may have held in the 1700s.      | [York County Probate Records 1700-1800](https://repository.upenn.edu/entities/dataset/b969a35b-a281-4974-940b-d2aa75c0efc6)     |
| Breast Cancer Diagnostic Features     | This displays data on features computed from digitized images of FNA of breast mass. It describes characteristics of cell nuclei present in the image. Coding would be useful in helping determine whether a picture of breast mass could potentially be cancerous based on analysis of data from this dataset. Additionally, it could help in categorizing and sorting the data.    | [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic)     |
